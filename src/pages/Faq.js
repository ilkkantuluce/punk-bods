          <b>What are punkbods?</b>
          <p>Punkbods is an art collection of 10,000 unique digilal characters stored on the Ethereum blockchain as non-fungible tokens (i.e. NFTs). They are designed lo be an extension lo cryplopunks. Each bod is an exact.1 to 1 match with an existing punk.</p>
        
          <b>Why did we create punkbods?</b>
          <p>As cryplopunk owners ourselves, we saw a gap in the NFT ecosystem for high quality, realistic bodies and accessories lo compliment our cryplopunks. We wanled Lo complete their identities and create a slory around who they are.</p>
        
          <b>Are punkbods worth collecting?</b>
          <p>Ultimately, the value of digilal art is subjective. We created these because that's what our hearts desired. We do not know who or how these characters will be used. Any transfers or collecting of the punkhods after the initial sale are out of our control and up to the discretion of the owner(s).</p>
  
          <b>Do I own the rights to usage of a punkbod?</b>
          <p>Absolutely, as these characters make their way into the world, we would love to see them imagined as physical prints, in comics. memes or adapted into other pieces of content.</p>
  
          <b>How did our team come together?</b>
          <p>We are a small team consisling of a programmer, an artist and a marketer. This project has been in the works for the last few months sparked by the excitement around cryptopunks. As a team. we have different competencies - technical, marketing and creative.</p>
